                                                THE WASTE DISTINGUISHER
this is an educational game where the target  is all the humans who produce waste basically every living human on earth.

It has a simple motive of telling people about the proper disposal of waste and segrigation of waste into proper bins,not monotonusly but in a challenging and fun way.

The player has to control 2 movements of two objects together ,the Dry Waste Bin and the Wet Waste Bin .


The 'SCORING' system works such that for every waste product you dispose/segregate correctly you recive a point 
Whereas when you drop a wet waste on the ground you recieve a negative point and when you drop any dry waste you get negative five

The game is an endless run you would loose when you put the  item in the wrong bin or reach a score of 0 again after reaching score of 10.

to see the debugging mode you may use 'tchr' 
it would show the collider of all the sprites and would show the frameRate and frameCount to you
To quit debug state  press 'q'

Hope you would enjoy
